## About Me

### Experience That Matters

With over 10 years of experience in software development, I've worked across diverse industries including telecommunications, fintech, and state and local government projects. Having collaborated with numerous coding contractors, I understand the frustration when projects go over budget, miss deadlines, and leave you with unmaintainable code.

My expertise spans a wide variety of languages and frameworks:

- **PHP** - Backend development and legacy system modernization
- **Vue.js** - Dynamic frontend applications and user interfaces
- **Next.js** - Full-stack React applications with server-side rendering
- **Java Spring** - Enterprise-level backend systems and APIs
\
\
I also bring extensive AWS infrastructure management experience, including Infrastructure as Code using the CDK for deployment and ongoing infrastructure maintenance.

### Communication is Key

What truly sets me apart is my ability to translate complex technical concepts into clear business language. I excel at bridging the gap between development teams and stakeholders, ensuring everyone understands:
::br
::
- **Current State** - What's broken in your existing codebase and why
- **Proposed Solutions** - How we'll fix the issues and prevent future problems
- **Business Impact** - The real-world value of clean, maintainable code
- **Long-term Strategy** - How proper code maintenance protects your investment
\
\
I believe that great code is only valuable when the business understands its impact. That's why I make technical communication a priority in every project.

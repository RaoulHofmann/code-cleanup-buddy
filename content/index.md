Located in Perth Western Australia with 10 years in the field of software development, I've solved cases across diverse industries including telecommunications, fintech, and state and local government projects. Having worked alongside numerous coding contractors, I've witnessed the aftermath when projects go astray - budget overruns, missed deadlines, and code so mysterious it would baffle even the most experienced developers.

My investigative toolkit includes mastery of multiple programming languages and frameworks:

- **PHP** - Solving legacy system mysteries and backend puzzles
- **Laravel** - Building elegant, maintainable PHP applications
- **Node.js** - Server-side JavaScript solutions
- **Vue.js** - Crafting dynamic frontend solutions
- **Next.js** - Building full-stack React applications
- **Java Spring** - Enterprise-level systems

I also possess extensive AWS infrastructure expertise, including Infrastructure as Code using the CDK - because even the finest detective needs reliable tools in the cloud.

### The Art of Technical Translation

What truly distinguishes my practice is the ability to translate complex technical mysteries into clear business language. I excel at bridging the gap between development teams and stakeholders, ensuring everyone understands:

- **The Evidence** - What's broken in your existing codebase and the root cause behind it
- **The Deduction** - How we'll solve the mystery and prevent future coding crimes
- **The Impact** - Why clean, maintainable code is more valuable than quick fixes
- **The Long Game** - How proper code maintenance protects your investment over time

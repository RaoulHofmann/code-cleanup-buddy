## The Detective Behind the Deduction

### A Consulting Detective's Experience
Located in Perth Western Australia with over 10 years in the field of software development, I've solved cases across diverse industries including telecommunications, fintech, and state and local government projects. Having worked alongside numerous coding contractors, I've witnessed the aftermath when projects go astray - budget overruns, missed deadlines, and code so mysterious it would baffle even the most experienced developers.

My investigative toolkit includes mastery of multiple programming languages and frameworks:

- **PHP** - Solving legacy system mysteries and backend puzzles
- **Laravel** - Building elegant, maintainable PHP applications with modern patterns
- **Node.js** - Server-side JavaScript solutions that scale efficiently
- **Vue.js** - Crafting dynamic frontend solutions with precision
- **Next.js** - Building full-stack React applications with optimal performance
- **Java Spring** - Enterprise-level systems that run smoothly and reliably

I also possess extensive AWS infrastructure expertise, including Infrastructure as Code using the CDK - because even the finest detective needs reliable tools in the cloud.

### The Art of Technical Translation

What truly distinguishes my practice is the ability to translate complex technical mysteries into clear business language. I excel at bridging the gap between development teams and stakeholders, ensuring everyone understands:

- **The Evidence** - What's broken in your existing codebase and the root cause behind it
- **The Deduction** - How we'll solve the mystery and prevent future coding crimes
- **The Impact** - Why clean, maintainable code is more valuable than quick fixes
- **The Long Game** - How proper code maintenance protects your investment over time

"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth." That's why I make technical communication as clear as my deductions - because brilliant code is only valuable when everyone can appreciate the solution.

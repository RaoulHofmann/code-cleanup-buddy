## About Me

### Experience That Matters

With over 10 years of experience in software development, I specialize in cleaning up and optimizing code across multiple technologies:

- **PHP**: Refactoring legacy applications and implementing modern PHP practices
- **Vue.js**: Creating clean, component-based frontend architectures
- **Next.js**: Building performant and maintainable React applications
- **Java Spring**: Restructuring enterprise applications for better maintainability
- **JavaScript**: Transforming spaghetti code into organized, testable modules

### Communication is Key

What sets me apart is my ability to communicate technical issues with non-technical stakeholders. I bridge the gap between complex technical concepts and business needs, ensuring everyone understands:

- The problems in the current codebase
- The solutions being implemented
- The business value of clean code
- The long-term benefits of proper code maintenance

I translate technical jargon into clear business language, helping you make informed decisions about your software assets.
